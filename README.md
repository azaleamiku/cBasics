# C Basics

A beginner-friendly collection of C programs—simple, direct, and designed to help you learn fundamental programming concepts in C.

## What’s Inside

This repository contains small, self-contained C programs that demonstrate core coding ideas such as variables, loops, functions, and basic input/output:

- **Getting Started**
  - `hello.c` – Classic “Hello, World!” introduction
  - `favAnimal.c` – Practice with printing and variables

- **Math and Calculations**
  - `add.c`, `addFunction.c` – Addition of numbers using direct code vs function approach
  - `area.c` – Compute the area of common shapes
  - `calc.c`, `calcFunction.c` – A small calculator: direct logic and modularized version

- **Counting and Summation**
  - `count.c` – Basic counting loop
  - `countSum.c` – Accumulate a total from multiple values

- **Loops and Control Flow**
  - `fLoop.c` – A demonstration of `for` loops
  - `ctrlWhile.c` – Looping using `while`
  - `infiniteLoop.c` – An intentionally infinite loop (use with caution!)

- **Data Types and Arrays**
  - `floats.c` – Work with floating-point variables
  - `array.c`, `foodArray.c` – Handle simple arrays of numbers and strings

- **Functions & Modularity**
  - `function.c` – Define and call a function
  - `greetFunction.c` – A function specifically for greeting the user

- **Conditional Logic**
  - `gradeChecker.c` – Check and output grade categories (pass/fail or letter grade)

## How to Compile and Run These Programs

Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed. Then simply:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azaleamiku/cBasics.git
cd cBasics
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
