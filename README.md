# C Basics

This repository contains a collection of fundamental C programs and code snippets, designed for learning and practicing core concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific idea, from basic syntax to functions and control flow.

## Current Topics

### Basic I/O and Syntax
* **hello.c**: A classic "Hello, World!" program.
* **print.c**: Demonstrates basic printing to the console.
* **input.c**: Shows how to take and handle user input.
* **floats.c**: An example of working with floating-point numbers.

### Control Flow and Loops
* **if.c**: Demonstrates simple conditional logic.
* **switch.c**: An example of a switch statement.
* **loop.c**: Shows how to use loops to repeat code.
* **for.c**: An example of a `for` loop.
* **do.c**: Demonstrates a `do-while` loop.
* **while.c**: An example of a `while` loop.

### Functions
* **function.c**: A simple example of creating and calling a function.
* **greetFunction.c**: A function that prints a greeting.
* **func.c**: Another function example.

### Arrays and Pointers
* **array.c**: An example of declaring and working with arrays.
* **pointers.c**: Demonstrates how to use pointers.

### Problem-Solving Examples
* **add.c**: Adds two numbers together.
* **area.c**: Calculates the area of a shape.
* **calc.c**: A basic calculator program.
* **count.c**: Counts something.
* **code.c**: A general code example.

## Planned Additions

I plan to add more examples for more advanced topics, including:
* File I/O
* Structures and Unions
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
